# WinkingBob
A halloween raspberry pi project. 

My kids and their friends made a scary mannequin for Halloween, and we repurposed the big red button and code from a [previous project](https://github.com/paulmaltby3/mrgoogleypoo) to make him say random phrases when his button is pushed. 

This is a the hideous Winking Bob when finished.
